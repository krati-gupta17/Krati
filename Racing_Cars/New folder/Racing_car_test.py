        The car needs to make a decision on how to move (what acceleration to give)
        based on these parameters

        Think carefully of what the features below should be

        Generally you have a Neural Network automatically, creating these features for you,
        but in this task you have to manually create useful features from the given parameters

        For example our thinking in creating our (rather simple) features was:
        ax is how fast the car moves forward, therefore it should depend on:
        * The car's current x velocity (vx)
        * how far the track is in the forward direction (dist_front_left, dist_front_right)

        ax is how fast the car moves sideways, therefore it should depend on:
        * how far the track is on it's either side (dist_left - dist_right)
        * The car's current y co-ordinate (y)
        * The car's current y velocity (vy)

        Your features can be as simple / as complicated as you want.

        features_x = np.array([params['vx'], params['dist_front_left'] * 1.4, params['dist_front_right'] * 1.4])

        Weights (W) are of shape (8,1) they are divided as below:

        Suppose W = [p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7], then:

        W1 = [p0 p1 p2]
        b1 = [p3]
        W2 = [p4 p5 p6]
        b2 = [p7]

        W1 = weights[0:3]
        b1 = weights[3]
        W2 = weights[4:7]
        b2 = weights[7]

        '''
        The weights are essentially acting like the coefficients (weights) in a
        linear sum of your features

        This is just our implementation, you have complete control of how you
        compute ax and ay using the weights and the feautures

        Suppose features_x = [fx0 fx1 fx2], features_y = [fy0 fy1 fy2], then:

        ax = tanh( p0*fx0 + p1*fx1 + p2*fx2  + p3) (scaled to correct acceleration range)
        ay = tanh( p4*fx4 + p5*fx5 + p6*fx6  + p7) (scaled to correct acceleration range)

        last assignment? (Can you use this to your advantage?)
